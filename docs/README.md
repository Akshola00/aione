## How does AI ONE WORK

AI One makes it easy to use Web3 DeFi. It combines several secure platforms into one simple chat that uses AI. If you want to send Sonic tokens to a friend or another address, AI One can help. You wonâ€™t need to search through different platforms or learn how to use them. AI One simplifies the process to ensure your tokens are sent safely.

With automatic slippage for transfers and an easy way to collect data using natural language, users can quickly send Sonic tokens from one wallet to another. This is just one of the features that AI One offers.

Let me help refine that section to be clearer and more professional while maintaining the same structure and information:

Let me enhance both feature descriptions to be more comprehensive and technically detailed:

### Swap Token Feature

This feature enables seamless token swaps on the Sonic network through an AI-powered natural language interface. Users can execute token exchanges by simply specifying their desired swap amount and token pairs. The system leverages the Zerepy agent framework to process these requests, automatically routing transactions through verified and audited smart contracts. The swap mechanism incorporates optimal routing algorithms and automatic slippage protection to ensure efficient token conversions at the best available rates.

The swap functionality interfaces directly with Sonic's liquidity pools to determine optimal exchange paths, and includes gas fee estimation, price impact calculations, and transaction confirmation processes. All executed swaps are fully traceable via transaction hashes provided in the response.

**Example Interaction:**

```
User: "swap amount 0.3 from 0x79bbF4508B1391af3A0F4B30bb5FC4aa9ab0E07C to 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE"
